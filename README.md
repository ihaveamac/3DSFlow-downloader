# 3DSFlow-downloader
This is for the "3DSFlow" project that started with [this GBAtemp thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/gridlauncher-3dsflow-project-box-cover-banners.405303/). This repository consists of two parts:

* A downloader for the Nintendo 3DS
* The site source code, officially hosted at https://ianburgwin.net/3dsflow

The site is mostly used for homebrew and custom banners, as official ones are usually handled by [GameTDB](http://www.gametdb.com) and its [Nintendo 3DS covers section](http://www.gametdb.com/3DS).

You can find older revisions of the site as a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/ihaveamac/b2229c8feb513476e745).

The downloader uses a modified lpp-3ds by Rinnegatamante. Please see [its repo](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/lpp-3ds) for more details, including license. The modification can be found at `extra/lpp-3ds-mod.zip`, with details at `extra/lpp-3ds Modifications.md`.
